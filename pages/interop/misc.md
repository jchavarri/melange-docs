## Browser support and polyfills

Melange compiles to JavaScript **ES5**, with the exception of allowing to compile to ES6 module import/export.

For [old browsers](https://caniuse.com/#search=typed%20array), you also need to polyfill TypedArray. The following OCaml standard library functions require it:

- `Int64.float_of_bits`
- `Int64.bits_of_float`
- `Int32.float_of_bits`
- `Int32.bits_of_float`

If you don't use these functions, you're fine. Otherwise, it'll be a runtime failure.

## Composing `bs` Attributes

As you might have guessed, most `bs.*` attributes can be used together. Here's an extreme example:

Note that `bs.splice` was renamed to `bs.variadic` after version 4.08

```ocaml
external draw: (_ [@bs.as "dog"]) -> int array -> unit = "draw" [@@bs.val] [@@bs.scope "global"] [@@bs.variadic]

let _ = draw [|1;2|]
```

## Safe External Data Handling

In some cases, the data could either come from JS or BS; it's very hard to give precise type information because of this. For example, for an external promise whose creation could come from the JS API, its failed value caused by `Promise.reject` could be of any shape.

Melange provides a solution, `bs.open`, to filter out OCaml structured exception data from the mixed data source. It preserves type safety while allowing you to deal with mixed source. It makes use of OCamlâ€™s extensible variant, so that users can mix values of type `exn` with JS data.

```ocaml
let handleData = function [@bs.open]
 | Invalid_argument _ -> 0
 | Not_found -> 1
 | Sys_error _ -> 2

(* handleData is 'a -> int option *)
```

For any input source, as long as it matches the exception pattern (nested pattern match supported), the matched value is returned, otherwise return `None`.

## NodeJS special variables

NodeJS has several file local variables: `__dirname`, `__filename`, `_module`, and `require`. Their semantics are more like macros instead of functions.

`bs.node` exposes support for these.

```ocaml
let dirname : string option = [%bs.node __dirname]
let filename : string option = [%bs.node __filename]
let _module : Node.node_module option = [%bs.node _module]
let require : Node.node_require option = [%bs.node require]
```
